### Notice
This is currently a work in progress. I will be expanding it as I continue studying the Genki textbooks. The reason I created this is mostly so I can setup exercises for myself to practice, however, you are free to use everything here as well. The self-study resources Genki provided are helpful, but not complete. I will try to work on exercises for all lessons, including practice and workbook problems, but again these will only become available as I study.
